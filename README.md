The Water Quality Monitoring System measures parameters like pH, turbidity, TDS, and temperature in real-time using advanced sensors. An ESP32 microcontroller processes and transmits data via a client-server network to a web platform. Scalable and IoT-enabled, it ensures efficient, proactive water quality management for safety and sustainability.
